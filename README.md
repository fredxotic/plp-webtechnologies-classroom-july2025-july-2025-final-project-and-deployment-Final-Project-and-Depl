🌟 About Me
Hi there! I'm Fred Kaloki, an ambitious learner and aspiring professional at the intersection of Business, Accounting, and Technology. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) at Egerton University while preparing for my Certified Public Accountant (CPA) qualification.

I believe in combining financial expertise with digital skills to prepare for the future of business. My journey has taken me from Upper Hill School to exploring the world of programming through PLP Academy, where I'm developing skills in Python, web development, and data science.
